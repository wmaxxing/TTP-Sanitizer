<h1> TTP-Sanitizer </h1>
<p> This is a small util project that is meant to take an excel spread sheet and transform it into two data types. TTP enterable data and Internal tracker data to streamline the efficiency and process of working as an Activity Tracker </p>

<p> Given this project is so small and the until is relatively uncomplicated I have choose to take a simple type of documentation style which will just explain the base functionality of loops and logic statements as needed. It follows that any viewers of this should have some sympathy this is not a code review. </p>
